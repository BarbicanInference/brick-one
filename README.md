# BrickOne

We're building our own "DynamicLand" / "FolkComputer" inspired "RoomOS".

The main idea : a Rules based server (first draft is using O'Doyle Rules in Clojure) which holds the model of the interactive space.

And which talks to various clients (including camera and projector managing agents) over WebSockets. 

This is the first brick in the wall. It is not yet a house. It is not even a room.
